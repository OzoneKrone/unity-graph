# Graphics Functions Project

This project is an exploration of graphic functions in a parallel programming environment. The graphic functions include "Graph" and "Fractal", implemented using kernel shaders.

## Graph Function

The "Graph" function generates a graphical representation based on a mathematical formula. The graph can represent a wide range of curves, surfaces, and patterns.

## Fractal Function

The "Fractal" function implements fractal algorithms such as the Mandelbrot set or Julia set. Fractals are complex geometric structures that exhibit self-similarity at different scales.
